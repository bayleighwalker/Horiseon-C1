Cleaning up and making small changes to the Horiseon webpage.

Added semantic elements and fixed one navigation link by adding an id tag to the 
‘Search Engine Optimization’ article. Semantics are broken down by nav, section, article, aside, and footer tags.
CSS file needed to be condensed because of repeating styles.

Screenshots of code changes:
